ABSTRACT

Microstrip patch antennas have become indispensable for wireless systems—ranging from smartphones and IoT devices to aerospace applications—due to their low profile, cost-efficiency, and ease of fabrication. In this research, we systematically compare five geometries (circular, F-shaped, triangular, square, and hexagonal) operating at 2.45 GHz on identical substrates, isolating the effect of shape on return loss, bandwidth, gain, and efficiency. Each design is simulated in CST Studio, then fabricated and tested using a Vector Network Analyzer, revealing that the circular patch consistently delivers the best overall performance. These findings confirm that small geometric variations can significantly boost antenna capabilities without increasing manufacturing complexity, thus offering a clear design path for engineers seeking high-performance yet cost-effective solutions. The work directly supports real-world applications in Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and satellite communication, where compact form and reliable signal quality are paramount.


1. Achieved up to −53 dB return loss and ~4.5% bandwidth using a circular patch, enabling more efficient and reliable communication in low-cost, space-constrained devices (e.g., IoT sensors, wearables).

2. Validated that shape optimization alone significantly boosts performance—cutting reflection losses and broadening bandwidth—without raising material or manufacturing expenses.

3. Provided a practical design blueprint for next-generation wireless modules, accelerating advancements in critical fields like aerospace, medical telemetry, and consumer electronics at 2.45 GHz.
